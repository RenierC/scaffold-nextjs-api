## Getting Started

This project uses Yarn Workspaces, so you'll need [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-ethereum-starter.git
cd nextjs-ethereum-starter

yarn install

# Start up the Hardhat Network
yarn chain
```

Here we just install the npm project's dependencies, and by running `yarn chain` we spin up an instance of Hardhat Network that you can connect to using MetaMask. In a different terminal in the same directory, run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This will deploy the contract to Hardhat Network. After this completes run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start up the Next.js development server and your site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

To interact with the local contract, be sure to switch your MetaMask Network to `Localhost 8545`

###[For chainlink oracle](#chainlink-oracle)

1. Added a folder in packages/frontend/api
2. Added a service with functions to interect with the contract in packages/frontend/service
3. Create an .env.local with the MNEMONIC at the root of frontend

The contract being used can be found here [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6C7792Cf38AaeFb063B74E5E73E1bC92f79B673d#code](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6C7792Cf38AaeFb063B74E5E73E1bC92f79B673d#code)

It uses chainlink's VRF v2

The functions functions of the api are mapped to the contract functions:

- s_randomWords
- s_requestId
- requestRandomWords

###To run the api requests

- `yarn dev` or `yarn start`

###The endpoints are

- [localhost:3000/api/getRequestId](http://localhost:3000/api/getRequestId)
- [localhost:3000/api/requestRandomWords](http://localhost:3000/api/requestRandomWords)
- [localhost:3000/api/getRandomWords/:id](http://localhost:3000/api/getRandomWords/1)
